PLACEHOLDER FOR PREVIEW.PNG

This file is a placeholder. Replace this with an actual PNG image file named "preview.png".

Recommended Preview Image Design:
=================================

Size: 600x400 pixels or 1200x800 pixels (2:3 aspect ratio)
Format: PNG

Design Concept:
- Screenshot of Visual Studio showing a highlighted .feature file
- Should showcase the syntax highlighting in action
- Use Visual Studio Dark Theme for the screenshot
- Show a variety of Gherkin elements to demonstrate the highlighting

What to Include in Screenshot:
1. Feature keyword and title (blue, bold)
2. Scenario with Given/When/Then steps (blue, bold)
3. Comments (green, italic)
4. Tags like @smoke @regression (light blue/cyan)
5. Parameters in angle brackets <param> or quotes "text" (light green)
6. A data table with pipes | cell | (yellow cells, gray pipes)
7. A doc string with """ (tan/brown)
8. Background or Rule keyword if possible

Example Feature File Content to Screenshot:
```gherkin
# User authentication feature
@smoke @regression
Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to log in securely

  Background:
    Given the system is online

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter username "john.doe"
    And I enter password "secret123"
    Then I should see the <dashboard>
    And I should see a message
      """
      Welcome back!
      """

  Scenario Outline: Multiple logins
    When I login as "<user>"
    Then I see <result>

    Examples:
      | user      | result    |
      | john.doe  | dashboard |
      | jane.doe  | dashboard |
```

Screenshot Tips:
- Use Visual Studio 2022 with Dark Theme
- Zoom to 100% or 125% for clarity
- Focus on the code editor area
- Crop out unnecessary UI elements
- Ensure text is crisp and readable
- No distracting elements in the background

Tools:
- Windows Snipping Tool
- ShareX (free)
- Greenshot (free)
- LightShot

Export Settings:
- PNG format
- High quality
- Appropriate resolution (600x400 minimum, 1200x800 recommended)

File must be named exactly: preview.png
Delete this .txt file after creating the actual PNG.
